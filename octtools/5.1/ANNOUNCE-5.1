--------------  Octtools 5.1 ------------------------------------

Octtools is a collection of programs and libraries that form an
integrated system for IC design.  The system includes tools for PLA
and multiple-level logic synthesis, state assignment, standard-cell,
gate-matrix and macro-cell placement and routing, custom-cell design,
circuit, switch and logic-level simulation, and a variety of utility
programs for manipulating schematic, symbolic, and geometric design
data.  Most tools are integrated with the Oct data manager and the VEM
user interface.

The Octtools distribution includes over 60 programs and 30 libraries,
some cell libraries (including the MSU 2.2 Standard Cell Library).

The software comes on a tape with about 32MB of compressed archives.
The unfolding of the distribution requires at least 66 MB, more (about
50MB more) if you
decide to unfold optional parts such as Spice, OctLisp, Bear-FP, or other
unsupported code.
About 130MB are required to build all the programs. After that,
executable can be stripped manually to save about 20MB. On the IBM
RS/6000 the disk requirements are about twice as much.

The software requires UNIX, the window system X11R4 including
the Athena Widget Set. The design manager VOV and a few other tools
require the C++ compiler \fBg++\fR.

Octtools-5.1 have been built and tested on the following combinations
of machines and operating systems: DECstation 3100, 5000 running
Ultrix 4.1 and 4.2; DEC VAX running Ultrix 4.1 and 4.2; Sun 3 and 4
running OS 4.0 and Sun SparcStation running OS 4.0.  The program has
been tried on the following machines, but is not supported: Sequent
Symmetry, IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.1.
