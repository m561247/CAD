The programs 'musa' and 'rpc-musa' are compiled off the same source
code.  This code can be compiled to either an X10 version of
'musa' and 'rpc-musa', or an X11 version of 'musa' and 'rpc-musa',
depending if the following constants are defined.  If the variable
'X11' is defined then the code will be compile such that X11 is
supported, else X10 will be supported.  If the variable 'RPC_MUSA'
is defined then the code will be compiled for 'rpc-musa'.  Appropriate
changes to the 'Makefile' will have to be made so that the correct
librarys are linked.
