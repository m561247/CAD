      			Start up vem and then use the mouse to bring up
the menu of options.  Under applications you should see the rpc-spice option.
Click it and you should get, among other things, an 'Operational' message
to appear in your VEM window.  Once it does, WHILE HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY, 
try to get the options menu back.  What will appear is the rpc-spice options
menu.  In order to get the regular menu don't hold down the shift key.
The functions have built in error messages to inform you if you're using
them the wrong way.  After invoking rpc-spice, look at the HELP manual or type
:user-help in VEM and everything is explanable from there.
