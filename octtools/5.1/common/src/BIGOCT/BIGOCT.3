The library libBIGOCT.a is the merging of all
the octtools libraries. It is provided as a quick way to link 
a program which is likely to require many
such libraries.

The use of this library should be considered only 
for tool prototypes. It is best to use 
create-octtools-makefile for a more careful linking of
packages.
