This is the top level directory for the Octtools 5.1 distribution.


To unfold the distribution, type 'PREINSTALL'.
Edit the INSTALL script and the type 'INSTALL'
to install the distribution.

Documentation can be found in ./document/PostScript

The base installation should take approximately (assuming a lightly
loaded machine):

	DEC VAX 8650/8800:	 3-4 hours
	Sequent Symmetry:	 2-3 hours (10 processors)
	IBM RS/6000 - 530	 2-3 hours
	DECSystem 5400:		 3.5 hours
	DECStation 3100:	 3-4 hours
	SUN 4/280:		 4-5 hours (NFS file system)
	SUN 3/160:		 7-8 hours (NFS file system)
	Microvax III:		16-17 hours (NFS file system)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation Problems (relative to an older version of Octtools 4.0):

****************************************************************************
****									****
**** USE OPTIMIZERS AT YOUR OWN RISK!  The Sequent, DEC (MIPS), and SUN	****
**** optimizers produce bad code for parts of the Oct Tools.		****
****									****
****************************************************************************

  - on the SUN and DECStation 2100/3100 you will get warning messages 
    during the {Light,Oct}Lisp installation concerning 'infinite loops'
    or '$! null predecessor cycle'.  They are caused by Makefile targets
    of the form:

	result: result

    You can ignore the warning messages; the targets are caused by 
    automatic Makefile generators and cause no problems for the build
    (other than creating a lot of warning messages and causing an old
    version of gnumake to core dump).


vem:
  - Vem now is an X toolkit compliant application.  What this means to you
    is that it uses the X toolkit to find the system defaults for Vem.  These
    are usually in some location like /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Vem.  Since
    the app-defaults directory is usually not writeable by the octtools user
    you will have to install ./src/vem/lib/Vem in that directory as root.


misII problems:

  - when building the misII problem, it builds an very large archive
    library - when the 'ranlib' command is applied to this library,
    /tmp is to store a temporary copy of this library, if your /tmp
    is smaller than 15 or 20 megabytes, this will fail.  You can
    get around this problem by replacing the version of ranlib you
    have with one that uses the local (current) directory to keep
    the temp file.  For DECstation 3100's, you can just modify the
    ranlib shell script and replace the 'ar ts' with 'ar tls'.  The
    same sort of file should work for other machines.


Machine specific information:

SUN 3:

    You might want to use the 68881 floating point unit if you have it,
    to do this, add 'setenv FLOAT_OPTION f68881' to the INSTALL script.


SUN 4 problems:

    OctLisp dies during `make test' on a SUN 4 running OS 4.0.


SEQUENT problems:

    using the optimizer (DYNIX(R) V3.0.12 NFS) causes bogus code
    to be generated, causing many tools to core dump (bogus code
    is generated in the Oct library (liboct.a)).

    puppy - tries to use parallel features but does not link with
    the necessary libraries (use puppyParallel instead)

    steps and rpc-steps do not compile. Portability problems
    with vsprintf() and some strangely written code.

HP (4.3 BSD UTAH) problems:

    OctLisp does not build.


HPUX 7.0 problems:

    LightLisp and OctLisp do not build
    
    add -lPW to LDFLAGS in ./src/octprop/Makefile
    remove -DBSD from ./src/misII/util/Makefile


DECStation 3100 problems:

   'eqn' does not exist; the document installation for 'TimberWolfSC-4'
    uses 'eqn', so this part of the installation will fail (no big deal).

    using -O2 on wolfe (file write_cell.c) will cause bogus code to be
    generated, causing wolfe to core dump.

    using -O2 on cds will cause an infinite loop.


IBM RS/6000 (AIX V3.1) problems:

    To install on the IBM RS/6000, add `-lbsd' to the LDFLAGS
    variable in the Makefile's of the following tools/packages:

	vulcan, atlas, atlast, cprep, jedi, wolfe, spider, mercury, utility

    Remove `-ltermlib' from the LDFLAGS variable in the Makefiles
    for `attache' and `rpc-attache-driver'.

    LightLisp and OctLisp do not build

    TimberWolfSC-4 (and thus wolfe) does not run correctly.


IBM RT (ACIS) problems:

    Modify the INSTALL script to pass 'CC=cc -U __STDC__' to the 'make'.
    [this may not be required anymore]


IBM RT (AIX V2.2) problems:

    [don't use V2.2, use V3.1]

    - sometimes you need to increate table space for the compiler...

    - 'ranlib' does not exist, in order to build you must create a 
      dummy ranlib, copy the following to '$OCTTOOLS/bin/ranlib' and
      chmod it to 755.

	#! /bin/csh
	exit 0

    - 'touch' does not have a '-f' flag so the 'touch -f version.c' in
      many of the Makefiles will fail - this is okay.

    - 'test' does not exist, so the 'test -f binary' in 'make test'
      portion of the Makefiles will fail.  In order to do 'make test'
      you should copy the following to '$OCTTOOLS/bin/test' and chmod
      it 755.

	#! /bin/csh
	exit 0
